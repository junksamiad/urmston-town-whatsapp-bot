# Phase 2: Local Testing Schedule and Results

This document outlines the comprehensive testing schedule for Phase 2 of the WhatsApp chatbot project and summarizes the results of both local testing and AWS deployment testing.

## Testing Approach

Our testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Mock-Based Testing**: The majority of our tests use mocks to avoid sending actual WhatsApp messages while still verifying our code logic.
2. **Limited Real Message Testing**: We limit real message testing to just a few messages, with explicit user confirmation required before sending.
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: We test error handling, edge cases, webhook responses, logging, security, and performance.
4. **Documentation**: Each test includes detailed output to help diagnose any issues that arise.

## Test Execution Schedule

### Phase 1: Mock-Based Testing ✅
1. Set up the test framework ✅
2. Run error handling tests ✅
3. Run edge case tests ✅
4. Run webhook response tests ✅
5. Run logging and security tests ✅
6. Run performance tests (mock-based) ✅

### Phase 2: Limited Real Message Testing ✅
1. Run the basic real message test (1 message) ✅
2. Run the fallback values test (1 message) ✅
3. Fix any issues identified in mock or real testing ✅

### Phase 3 (Optional): Concurrency Testing ✅
1. Gather multiple test phone numbers ✅
2. Run the concurrency test with explicit approval ✅
3. Document the results and any issues ✅

**Note**: These phases don't need to be executed on separate days. They can be run whenever convenient, but should be executed in order, with each phase building on the successful completion of the previous one.

## Testing Progress

### Phase 1: Mock-Based Testing (COMPLETED)

We have successfully completed all the mock-based tests in Phase 1. Here's a summary of the results:

1. **Error Handling Tests**: All tests passed successfully. The system correctly handles invalid phone numbers, missing required fields, Twilio service disruptions, invalid API keys, and malformed JSON payloads.

2. **Edge Case Tests**: All tests passed successfully. The system properly handles minimum required fields, very long field values, special characters in fields, international phone numbers, and empty strings for optional fields.

3. **Webhook Response Tests**: All tests passed successfully. The system correctly processes basic webhook messages, webhooks with media, webhooks with empty bodies, malformed webhook payloads, and missing MessageSid.

4. **Logging and Security Tests**: 
   - All security tests now pass correctly, including missing API key, invalid API key, valid API key, and case-insensitive API key header tests.
   - Logging tests now pass, with request_id properly included in all log messages.

5. **Performance Tests**: All tests passed successfully. The system demonstrates good response times (around 0.0015-0.0024 seconds per request) and handles sequential requests efficiently.

### Issues Fixed:

1. **API Key Validation**: We identified and fixed an issue where the test framework was bypassing the API key validation by directly calling `handle_trigger` or `handle_webhook` instead of going through the `lambda_handler` function. We updated the test framework to call `lambda_handler` with a properly formatted event that mimics the API Gateway v2 format.

2. **Request ID Logging**: We fixed an issue with request_id logging by configuring the logging system to include the request_id in the log format.

### Phase 2: Limited Real Message Testing (COMPLETED)

We have successfully completed the limited real message testing in Phase 2:

1. **Basic Message with Template Variables**: This test passed successfully. The system correctly sent a WhatsApp message using the custom variables provided in the payload.

2. **Message with Fallback Values**: This test passed successfully. The system correctly sent a WhatsApp message using the fallback values defined in the Twilio template.

Both messages were received promptly and contained the expected content. The system demonstrated reliable message delivery in real-world conditions.

### Phase 3: Concurrency Testing (COMPLETED)

The optional concurrency test was conducted with four test phone numbers. All messages were sent and received successfully, with an average response time of under 1 second per message.

## AWS Deployment ✅

The WhatsApp chatbot has been successfully deployed to AWS with the following configurations:

1. **Lambda Function**: Updated with the latest code that includes both Twilio integration and comprehensive testing.
2. **Environment Variables**: Configured to use SSM Parameter Store for Twilio configuration:
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Retrieved from `/urmston/twilio/phone-number`
   - `TWILIO_TEMPLATE_SID`: Retrieved from `/urmston/twilio/template-sid`
3. **IAM Permissions**: Added explicit permissions for the Lambda function to access the SSM parameters.
4. **Timeout**: Increased to 10 seconds to ensure sufficient time for processing.
5. **API Gateway**: Configured with proper routes and API key authentication.

## AWS Deployment Testing

A separate testing plan for the AWS deployment has been created in `docs/phase2/phase2_testing_plan.md`. This plan includes:

1. Basic functionality tests for the trigger endpoint
2. Authentication and security tests for API key validation
3. Error handling tests for missing fields and invalid phone numbers
4. Performance and concurrency tests with both sequential and concurrent requests

Each test includes clear objectives, step-by-step instructions, and actual curl commands or bash scripts that can be run to verify the deployment.

## Next Steps

With the successful completion of all testing phases and the deployment to AWS, the WhatsApp chatbot is now ready for production use. The system has demonstrated its reliability, performance, and robustness through comprehensive testing and real-world message delivery.

The next phase of the project will focus on:
1. Setting up monitoring and alerting
2. Implementing additional features such as storage of registration data in DynamoDB
3. Enhancing the conversational flow based on user feedback
